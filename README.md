# SalaryPrediction

## Abstract
This project, housed in a comprehensive repository, is a final project developed for the Data Intensive Application Programming course. It focuses primarily on analysing and predicting employee salaries using various machine learning techniques.

The repository is well structured and includes both code and documentation to ensure ease of understanding and reproducibility. A unique feature of this project is the inclusion of a notebook, available in both English and Italian, which provides a detailed description of the data analysis process and the comparison of different predictive models obtained with various machine learning techniques.

The overall aim of this project is to provide insight into salary distribution and to develop a reliable model for predicting salaries. This could be a valuable tool for both employers and employees in the future. The project highlights the power of data-intensive applications and their potential to support informed decision making.
